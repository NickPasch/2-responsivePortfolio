# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

DEPLOYED WEBSITE: https://nickpasch.github.io/2-responsivePortfolio/

In this assignment, I created a website that will serve as a portfolio for my work so future employers can view it. It includes a navbar, a home page that has a bio, links to my social media, and an image of myself, a contact page with a form that people can use to send me enquiries, and a portfolio page which will showcase my work once I have some. 

I used the bootstrap responsive grid system on every page, and it proved immensely useful. I got my navbar from bootstrap, too, although I did modify it considerably. The form was loosely based on a form from bootstrap, as well as the cards that I will be using for my work that I showcase in the future which were directly taken from bootstrap.
